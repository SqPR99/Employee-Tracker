## [Description](#table-of-contents)
This application was created using MYSQL in order to track employees and store information in a database
## [Installation](#table-of-contents)
In order to install this application, the user needs to clone the repository and open it up in their code editor of choice. The user needs to populate the .env file in the repository. Once populated with the users information, they can seed the database by running mysql -u root -p in the terminal. Once logged into your MYSQL you need to run "source ./db/schema.sql" and then "source ./db/seeds.sql" Once that's all installed you can run the database 
## [Usage](#table-of-contents)
Once the database is seeded, you can run the command node server.js in the temrinal to start the application. There you will be greated with multiple choices - View Employees, View Employees by Department, Add Employees, Update Employee Role, Add Role and Exit. In those options you can choose what you like depending on your setup.
